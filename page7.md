> The event based character of twitter exchanges is what shapes the number of mentions 

As seen on Cortext’s Demography tool, the representative that accounted for the biggest number of mentions was Frederica Wilson, due to the events that happened within the timeframe of the collection of the data (from October 14th 2017 to October 28th 2017). 

Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi also accounted for a large number of mentions during this period due to events that involved them. Donald Trump is constantly present throughout this two weeks of data collection, and so are other relevant political figures such as Hillary Clinton and media outlets such as CNN and Fox News. 

The most repeated hashtags have a direct correlation with the user names that got the most mentions, proving once again how event based the results are. 

The hashtags “Niger”, ”SgtLaDavidJohson” and “IBelieveFrederica” are directly related to Representative Frederica Wilson and the [event] (https://www.thedailybeast.com/frederica-wilson-vs-trump-and-now-john-kelly-easygo-with-wilson) that took place on October 19th, when she [criticized] (http://time.com/4993045/myeshia-johnson-donald-trump-frederica-wilson/) President Trump for the way he handled the death of Sgt. La David Johnson in Niger.

The hashtags “IranDeal” and “TrumpRussia” are directly linked to representative Adam Schiff. He is deeply involved in foreign policy issues and [expressed] (https://schiff.house.gov/news/press-releases/intel-committee-ranking-member-schiff-statement-on-president-trumps-decision-to-decertify-iran-dealhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/us/politics/russia-investigation-congress-intelligence-committees-gowdy.html) his opinion about president Trump and the possibility to decertify the Iran Deal. He also criticized Trump's action regarding the Russian election. He gave several interviews about this and was vocal with his criticism on his Twitter account, where he even sometimes addressed Trump’s Twitter account directly.

The hashtags “BillionairesFirst”,”GOP Budget” and “NotOnePenny” are connected to representative Nancy Pelosi. She is very vocal in her criticism on Trump. In October 14th, during the two weeks of data collection, she stated: "I'm not sure the President has understood that a president's words weigh a ton and you can't say things casually." Pelosi said this mostly in regard of the effect Trump’s words have on foreign politics, however, on her twitter account, she is also very vocal about internal political issues, the #BillionairesFirst hashtag refers to her harsh [criticism] (http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2017/10/26/trumps-plan-to-eliminate-salt-will-shave-10-off-value-your-home-pelosi.html) towards USA’s system of taxation.
