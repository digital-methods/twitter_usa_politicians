> We decided to divide our sample into two groups, defining representatives above the age of 50 as “old” and below 50 as “young”. However, we noticed throughout our research, that this division does not necessarily make sense. The problem in this regard is that our sample does have a rather poor age distribution, given the fact, that the vast majority of the representatives are not young but rather old. There are only 31 representatives between the ages of 18 and 50, and 165 representatives older than 50. The differences we spotted between the groups were small, we still obtained some results based on the division we made, however. We found that “young representatives” tend to receive insults such as “motherfucker” or “weak”, while the “old” representatives received more insults such as “degenerate”, “pig”, ”loudmouth”, “bigot” or “hypocrite”.

> The only strong obtainable result in this matrix is that young representatives tend to be insulted as “flake” and “hack”. The rest of the matrix shows no outstanding results.
