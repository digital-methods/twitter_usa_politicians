The results based on sexual orientation are not as representative as the ones concerning the other characteristics, because our studied group only contained six openly non-heterosexual representatives, five of whom identified as homosexual and one bisexual. The rest of the representatives studied identify as straight. However, we still obtained some results in network mapping about the insults people received based on their sexual orientation that can be obtained from this network. It is divided into three main groups, a yellow “bisexual one, a green one “straight” representing the heterosexual representatives, and a blue “gay” one, that represents the homosexual representatives. We notice that the two non-heterosexual groups receive more and different insults than the straight group and that they are also better connected, even though the straight group is far larger than the two other groups. Heterosexual representatives tend to receive insults such as “racist”, “trash”, “idiot”, “crazy” or “whore”, generic yet sometimes misogynist insults. The LGB (acronym for lesbian, gay, bisexual) representatives however, tend to receive insults such as “ass”, “Douche”, “coward”, “hypocrite”, “rat”, “flake” or “extremist”. Generally speaking, we cannot state that there are relevant differences in the insults the three groups receive.


> ## B.  Contingency Matrix Analysis - by sexual orientation 
The contingency matrix script proposes to visualize the joint distribution of the list of insults that we created (after parsing all the data) and the classification of politicians by sexual orientation. The aim is to see which group, according to the categories we defined, received the heavier, more skewed insults.

The results based on sexual orientation are not as representative as the ones concerning the other characteristics, because our studied group only contained six openly non-heterosexual representatives, five of whom identified as homosexual and one bisexual. The rest of the representatives studied identify as straight. This lack of data is visible in this contingency matrix: the results are too poor to draw any analysis.
