# Contingency Matrix Analysis
The contingency matrix script proposes to visualize the joint distribution of the list of insults that we created (after parsing all the data) and the classification of politicians by sexual orientation. The aim is to see which group, according to the categories we defined, received the heavier, more skewed insults. 

## Contingency Matrix - by sexual orientation

The results based on sexual orientation are not as representative as the ones concerning the other characteristics, because our studied group only contained six openly non-heterosexual representatives, five of whom identified as homosexual and one bisexual. The rest of the representatives studied identify as straight. This lack of data is visible in this contingency matrix: the results are too poor to draw any analysis.
