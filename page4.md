> # Contingency Matrix Analysis
The contingency matrix script proposes to visualize the joint distribution of the list of insults that we created (after parsing all the data) and the classification of politicians by gender. The aim is to see which group, according to the categories we defined, received the heavier insults.

The contingency matrix shows the degree of correlation between the pairs. The red cells, which show the most correlation as we see in this graph is air pollution and air quality in the South China Morning Post. But if we look at air quality and air pollution in China daily, the correlation is dark blue, which means that there is little to no correlation between this term/topic and this newspaper source. Considering that it is the main source of news outlet in China, it is quite skeptical that there is no mention of air pollution or air quality. The other news sources like South China Peopleâ€™s Daily, also has little to no mention of air quality and air pollution, while Shanghai Daily has a higher correlation but not too high. Finally, Global Times has a higher correlation (more orange).
