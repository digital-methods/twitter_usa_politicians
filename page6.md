> Topic Modelling

> The technique was developed by [David Blei](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/) and others. The [Journal of Digital Humanities](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/2-1/topic-modeling-a-basic-introduction-by-megan-r-brett/) has prepared an introductory article on topic modeling, which features this short definition: <i>"Topic modeling is a form of text mining, a way of identifying patterns in a corpus. You take your corpus and run it through a tool which groups words across the corpus into ‘topics’. Miriam Posner has described topic modeling as “a method for finding and tracing clusters of words (called “topics” in shorthand) in large bodies of texts."</i>

> The tremendous growth of social media content on the Internet has inspired the development of the text analytics to understand and solve real-life problems. Leveraging statistical topic modelling helps researchers and practitioners in better comprehension of textual content as well as provides useful information for further analysis. Statistical topic modelling becomes especially important when we work with large volumes of dynamic text, e.g., Facebook or Twitter datasets.

> In our case, as we can guess from the topic modelling most relevant themes, each generated cluster corresponds to one American politician.
