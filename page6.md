# Topic Modelling

> The technique was developed by [David Blei](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/) and others. Topic modelling is a type of statistical model for discovering the abstract "topics" that occur in a collection of documents. Topic modeling is thus a frequently used text-mining tool for discovery of hidden semantic structures in a text body.

> The tremendous growth of social media content on the Internet has inspired the development of the text analytics to understand and solve real-life problems. Leveraging statistical topic modelling helps researchers and practitioners in better comprehension of textual content as well as provides useful information for further analysis. Statistical topic modelling becomes especially important when we work with large volumes of dynamic text, e.g., Facebook or Twitter datasets.

> 2. Donald Trump
> 3. Myeshia Johnson
> 4. Frederica Wilson
> 5. Johnson & Trump


##  Why are those politicians and not others getting the most tweets?  

> Donald Trump is well known for insulting people who criticize him. But African-American women who challenge the president and his administration are both more likely to be singled out for spite and likely to face a wave of racially-tinged insults and threats from the extremists among Trump’s fan base.

> The administration’s latest target is Myeshia Johnson, the pregnant widow of an army sergeant killed in Niger this month. After she appeared on Good Morning America this morning (Oct. 23) to confirm earlier reports that the president had seemed unsympathetic and forgotten her husband’s name during a condolence call, Trump quickly implied that she had been lying:

> Frederica Wilson, the African American congresswoman from Florida has also faced the ire of the administration. On Oct. 19, White House chief of staff John Kelly called Wilson, 74, an “empty barrel.” He also accused her of having taken credit for getting funding for an FBI building in Florida during a 2015 speech—a false accusation, as video of Wilson’s speech shows. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders repeated the “empty barrel” phrase in a press conference; former Sheriff David Clarke, a spokesman for a pro-Trump political committee, called Wilson a “buffoon;” and Trump himself has called her “wacky” three times on Twitter.
