From this network map of insults characterized by ethnicity, we can see that most terms pulled are in conjunction with "White", the next largest conjunction with "Black", following with "Latino", "IndianAmerican", and "Asian". By far, the "Black" node is the largest of all defined clusters. Apart from general insults ("idiot", "stupid", "moron", etc.), most ties are relatively unsurprising as they represent American racial stereotypes and the racial slurs that accompany them ("Latino" and "beaner", "White" and "elitist", and "Black" and "pig" or "scum").

Unsurprisingly as well, most insults based upon politics and political party are associated with the "White" node, such as "nazi", "crony", "alt-right", "alt-left", and "deep state" since whites are the racial majority in the democratic House of Representatives as well as government in general. Under the "Black" node, several of the words seem to be skewed more toward women, such as in "crazy", "whore", "cunt", and "loudmouth". Along with the large size of the "Black" node from the data we collected from these two weeks, this is surely due to the controversy surrounding Frederica Wilson at this time.

One of the more interesting ties are between "Black" and the insult "racist" since, in the American context, the word is most commonly used in expressing oppression of racial minorities. Thus, effective dissection of this part of the map could only be done by analyzing the content of those tweets themselves.

## Contingency Matrix - by ethnicity

This contingency matrix based upon insults by ethnicity shows that for the most part, largely between "Black" and "White", there is relative low correlation. The darkest red blocks are showing a stronger correlation with "White" being associated with "hack" and "flake" than with "Black". Surpringly, the insult "racist" is more closely associated with "Black" than with "White", with "White" having a very low correlation in general. However, as described above as well, this is surely due to Frederica Wilson's controversy at the time the data was pulled. This would also explain the stronger association of "whore", "pig", and "ugly", to "Black" than to "White" during this time, as they are feminized insults.
