From this network mapping of insults characterized by ethnicity, we can see that most terms pulled are in conjunction with "White", the next largest conjunction with "Black", following with "Latino", "IndianAmerican", and "Asian". Apart from general insults ("idiot", "stupid", "moron", etc.), most ties are relatively unsurprising as they represent American racial stereotypes and the racial slurs that accompany them ("Latino" and "beaner", "White" and "elitist", and "Black" and "pig" or "scum").

One of the more interesting ties are between "Black" and the insult "racist", since in the American context, the word is most commonly used in expressing oppression of racial minorities. Thus, effective dissection of this part of the map could only be done by analyzing the content of those tweets themselves.
