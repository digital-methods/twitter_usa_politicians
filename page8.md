# Limitations. How to solve them?

> ## 1. Reduce probability of tweets to be event based: Compare the sample with all representatives to this same sample but after removing Frederica Wilson and Nancy Pelosi, two women accounting for the majority of tweets in those two weeks.

Ethnicity and gender: Because much of the data pulled for these two weeks of Twitter insults are skewed due to current events, it is necessary to pull out larger actors in the news/media in order to reach a more representative conclusion about what treatment democrat House of Representatives regularly receive on the platform. From the information we can interpret from the network mapping and contingency matrices as the insults lean heavily toward black and female, we can say with relative certainty that Frederica Wilson's controversy greatly influenced this, in both size and in content. In the network map for ethnicity and gender below, when Wilson is removed, the results are divided much more equally among groups and represent a more realistic picture of the democrats in the House of Representatives in America's current political climate.

## Network mapping: Mixed category: ethnicity and gender - for all representatives

## Network mapping: Mixed category: ethnicity and gender - we removed Frederica Wilson (black woman) from the list who was, to a large degree, the most mentioned representative during those two weeks.

Another way to look at this finding is by looking at the contingency matrix for both samples
