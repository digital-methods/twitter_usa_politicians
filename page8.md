# Limitations. How to solve them?

A difficulty we encountered over the course of our research is one that is connected to the choice of our medium: the social network Twitter. We noticed that the results we obtained were extremely event-based, because that is the main scope of use for Twitter. People tweet about current events, about the News, react to influential tweets. This makes it difficult to receive adequate comparable results over a rather short time frame, such as the one we had (two weeks). For this reason, we though about different ways to solve this main limit of our research.

> ## 1. Reduce probability of tweets to be event based: Compare the sample with all representatives to this same sample but after removing Frederica Wilson and Nancy Pelosi, two women accounting for the majority of tweets in those two weeks.

Ethnicity and gender: Because much of the data pulled for these two weeks of Twitter insults are skewed due to current events, it is necessary to pull out larger actors in the news/media in order to reach a more representative conclusion about what treatment democrat House of Representatives regularly receive on the platform. From the information we can interpret from the network mapping and contingency matrices as the insults lean heavily toward black and female, we can say with relative certainty that Frederica Wilson's controversy greatly influenced this, in both size and in content. In the network map for ethnicity and gender below, when Wilson is removed, the results are divided much more equally among groups and represent a more realistic picture of the democrats in the House of Representatives in America's current political climate.

## Network mapping: Mixed category: ethnicity and gender - for all representatives

## Network mapping: Mixed category: ethnicity and gender - we removed Frederica Wilson (black woman) from the list who was, to a large degree, the most mentioned representative during those two weeks.

Another way to look at this finding is by looking at the contingency matrix for both samples

> ## 2. Random sampling of tweets
Instead of taking into account all politicians' tweets, and in order to reduce the bias we have encountered in our research, we thought of picking just 10-20 tweets per representative. This way, we will avoid skewed, biased results as we have shown for the case of Frederica Wilson. Consequently, our results will be much less sensitive to the events that took place in the periods studied.
