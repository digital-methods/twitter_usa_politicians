# Data and Methodology
> A dataset consisting of a sample of 199 US Democratic House of representatives was used for further analysis and understanding of the research question. 
This dataset was analysed against the following variables: 
- age
- gender
- race 
- sexual orientation

> Overall, the [democratic house of representatives](http://www.dems.gov/members/) has approximately 54 females, 145 males, 2 gays, 1 bisexual, 102 whites, 21 latinos/hispanics, 41 blacks and 8 Asian-Americans. The twitter accounts/identity/name for each house representative was another key identifier. The first step to this analysis was applying the API keys to the dataset in order to trace trends or patterns from the twitter feeds of the representativesâ€™ twitter accounts. This was done for a period of two weeks from Sat October 14th 2017 to Sat October 28th 2017 for consistency and more accurate data given the ever changing and rapid turn of twitter events or tweets.

## Insults list
> A terms list of possible insults was developed based on the personal knowledge of one of our group members who grew up in the United States as well as supplementary lists of compiled insults based upon race, gender, religion, and political party in the American context. However, we were met with a couple obstacles when attempting to expand this list. Firstly, because of the nature of this research project, insulting words added were largely focused on those that would be used by a younger population, for the most part, since those are the majority of Twitter users. After exhausting these, any addition of insulting words that were more out of date would not have changed results dramatically. Secondly, all lists of slurs associated with race, gender, religion, and political party were exhausted to our best efforts based upon the diversity that was present in democrat House of Representatives. Insulting words that could be used outside of the different races and religions presents in the group were added as well to account for any mislabeling done by the public.

> Various tools as will be illustrated in the following pages (Networking mapping, contingency mapping, topic modelling and demographics) were applied in order to gain a deeper and better understanding of the language used towards politicians on social media specifically on Twitter.
