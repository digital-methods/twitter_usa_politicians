# Data and Methodology
> A dataset consisting of a sample of 199 US Democratic House of representatives was used for further analysis and understanding of the research question. 
This dataset was analysed against the following variables: 
- age
- gender
- race 
- sexual orientation

> Overall, the [democratic house of representatives](http://www.dems.gov/members/) has approximately 54 females, 145 males, 2 gays, 1 bisexual, 102 whites, 21 latinos/hispanics, 41 blacks and 8 Asian-Americans. The twitter accounts/identity/name for each house representative was another key identifier. The first step to this analysis was applying the API keys to the dataset in order to trace trends or patterns from the twitter feeds of the representativesâ€™ twitter accounts. This was done for a period of two weeks from Sat October 14th 2017 to Sat October 28th 2017 for consistency and more accurate data given the ever changing and rapid turn of twitter events or tweets.
