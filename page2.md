> The results based on gender revealed a high correlation between the gender of the representative and the type of insult s/he would receive.  In our case,  the contingency matrix confirms and offers another visualization of the network mapping analysis. The colour partition is whether blue for male and red for female representatives,  and vice versa. The genders never share the same type of insults, which confirms that insults are gender based. On the one hand, female representatives receives more gender targeted insults, referring to their womanhood, as “bitch”, “ugly”, “whore”. Those insults are related to the physical appearance and sexual behaviour. On the other hand, male representatives receives more general insults and related with intelligence and responsibility as ”fool”, ”loser” or “fake”, “flake”.  The observation demonstrates that female representatives suffers from heavier insults. Last but not the least, the analysis of the gender based distribution of insults confirms a more general phenomenon, the distribution between men and women, as men representatives of rationality, and women passive sexual beings. Therefore, insults towards male representatives would tackle their rationality and capacity to make decision, whereas insults towards women would tackle their body and presumed irrationality, as “crazy”.

> The contingency matrix visualizes  the intensity of the correlation of the term list of insults we derived after parsing the Twitter API keys and  the gender of the representative. The aim is to assess  if there is a gender-based distribution of the insults.   To measure the intensity of the correlation, the contingency matrix matches colour and area as representation of the joint distribution between two items. The colour gradation illustrates a strong correlation for the dark red cells, and a weak correlation for the blue cells.
