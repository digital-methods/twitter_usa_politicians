> The network mapping evidences the correlations between differents terms, based on the analysis of the nodes between the terms, based on proximity measurements.  The closest the term is to the center of the nodes, the more cited it was.  The network mapping gives an easy reading illustration of the relations between different terms.  Our objective was to analyse the insults received by the representatives, according to their gender.  

> The two networks maps obtained differs in term of size and content. First, the male representatives network map seems bigger than the female one. Consequently, one may  think that male representatives receive more insults than female. However, the observation is wrong. Male representatives do not receive more insults than women. They account for a big percentage over the total sample of representatives.  Then, on the nature of the insults,  the differents nodes between gender and the insults enable to affirm that the insults are gender based.  Female representatives receive differents insults as “cunt”, “pussy”, slut”, “hoe”crazy”, and male representatives as “stupid”, “fool”, “dick”, “weak” .  Indeed, women receive heavier insults than men. Female representatives insults are usually linked with sexuality and the body, whereas male representatives insults are linked with power and intelligence. 

> Some correlations as the use of “racist” for female representatives or “nazi” for male representatives appear to be event-based. They do not represent the overall general trend. 


> ## B. Contingency Matrix - by gender

> The contingency matrix visualizes  the intensity of the correlation of the term list of insults we derived after parsing the Twitter API keys and  the gender of the representative. The aim is to assess  if there is a gender-based distribution of the insults.   To measure the intensity of the correlation, the contingency matrix matches colour and area as representation of the joint distribution between two items. The colour gradation illustrates a strong correlation for the dark red cells, and a weak correlation for the blue cells. 

> The contingency matrix reveals a high correlation between female representatives  and racist. This correlation is triggered, because it was an event based causality. We believed that the “racist” insult was especially targeting Frederica Wilson. The representative was involved in specific discussion on Twitter during the two weeks when we collected the datas. 

> The results based on gender revealed a high correlation between the gender of the representative and the type of insult s/he would receive.  In our case,  the contingency matrix confirms and offers another visualization of the network mapping analysis. The colour partition is whether blue for male and red for female representatives,  and vice versa. The genders never share the same type of insults, which confirms that insults are gender based. On the one hand, female representatives receives more gender targeted insults, referring to their womanhood, as “bitch”, “ugly”, “whore”. Those insults are related to the physical appearance and sexual behaviour. On the other hand, male representatives receives more general insults and related with intelligence and responsibility as ”fool”, ”loser” or “fake”, “flake”.  The observation demonstrates that female representatives suffers from heavier insults. Last but not the least, the analysis of the gender based distribution of insults confirms a more general phenomenon, the distribution between men and women, as men representatives of rationality, and women passive sexual beings. Therefore, insults towards male representatives would tackle their rationality and capacity to make decision, whereas insults towards women would tackle their body and presumed irrationality, as “crazy”.
